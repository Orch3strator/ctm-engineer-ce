# CTM Engineer

Control-M Engineer - Control-M Pre-Execution Validation Tool

## Overview

This project ensures that all required resources for scheduled Control-M workflows (folders) are available one hour before execution. 
It provides inventory checks, workflow validation, and monitoring to help the operations team proactively address potential issues before the actual run.


### Key Features

âœ… Inventory Management â€“ Retrieve and review Control-M folders, workflows, and their dependencies.

âœ… Folder Inventory â€“ Get a folder's **Managed File Transfer** job dependencies.

âœ… Agent Availability Check â€“ Ensure that Control-M agents executing the workflows are up and running.

âœ… Basic Monitoring â€“ Track workflow dependencies and status.

âœ… Expert Mode â€“ Provides deep monitoring, validating server, connections, agents, and workflow dependencies in a single execution.

### Use Case

- A business user schedules a folder/workflow for execution at a specific time.
- This project pre-checks all required resources (agents, connections, workflows) one hour before the scheduled execution.
- The operations team is notified if any critical resources are unavailable.
- Ensures a smooth, error-free execution when the workflow runs.

### Why This Project?

ðŸ”¹ Prevents workflow failures due to missing resources.

ðŸ”¹ Reduces operational downtime with proactive monitoring.

ðŸ”¹ Enhances reliability of Control-M job executions.
